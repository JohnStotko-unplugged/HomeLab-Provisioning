# HomeLab-Provisioning
Scripts and instructions to help setup fresh machines for the home lab.

The home lab setup is supposed to not be connected to the internet 
as a measure of added security. Therefore, setup might be different
then what's on many setup guides. For example, we won't be able to just
```apt install``` packages or ```docker pull``` images since they need 
to be fetches from a repository over the internet. 

For more info on the security considerations, refer to [Security Considerations](security.md)


That being said, instructions will differ quite a bit for adding a new 
machine to an existing system, or starting a fresh network.
